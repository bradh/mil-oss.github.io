## Welcome to Mil-OSS!

Welcome to the (new and updated) Mil-OSS website.  At one time we were hosted on mil-oss.org, but that domain was accidentally allowed to lapse and picked up by someone else.  So we're restarting on this website, mil-oss.dev.  We don't know who has mil-oss.org now.

## Instructions for modifying the site

The following are instructions on how to edit the site. This site is hosted on GitHub pages.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mil-oss/mil-oss.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mil-oss/mil-oss.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
