## Welcome to Mil-OSS!

Welcome to the (new and updated) Mil-OSS website https://mil-oss.dev.  This site is for discussing the relationship of open source software (OSS) and the military. We focus on the U.S. military, the US Department of Defense (DoD).

If you want to discuss things, please talk on our [Mil-OSS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/mil-oss).

We have various OSS projects available on our GitHub page, https://github.com/mil-oss.

Note about websites: At one time we (Mil-OSS) were hosted on mil-oss.org, but that domain was accidentally allowed to lapse and picked up by someone else.  So we've restarted our website here on https://mil-oss.dev.  We don't know who controls mil-oss.org now.

## Key materials

* ["Clarifying Guidance Regarding Open Source Software (OSS)"](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/2009OSS.pdf) - the key DoD-wide policy on OSS.
