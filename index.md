## Welcome to Mil-OSS!

Welcome to the (new and updated) Mil-OSS website [https://mil-oss.dev](https://mil-oss.dev).  This site is for discussing the relationship of open source software (OSS) and the military. We focus on the U.S. military, the US Department of Defense (DoD).

If you want to discuss things, please talk on our [Mil-OSS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/mil-oss).

We have various OSS projects available on our GitHub page; see [https://github.com/mil-oss](https://github.com/mil-oss).

## Key materials

* [*Clarifying Guidance Regarding Open Source Software (OSS)* (2009)](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/2009OSS.pdf) [local copy](resources/2009OSS.pdf) - the key DoD-wide policy on OSS.
* [*DoD Open Source Software (OSS) FAQ*](https://dodcio.defense.gov/open-source-software-faq/)

## What happened to mil-oss.org?

At one time we (the original Mil-OSS group) were hosted on mil-oss.org, but that domain was accidentally allowed to lapse and picked up by someone else.  We don't know who controls mil-oss.org now.  So we've restarted our website here on https://mil-oss.dev.
